# SimpleSurvival
This spigot plugin is a all in one survival server plugin. The goal of this plugin is to make it very simple to run a survival type server. 

This plugin will provide the basic commands. Commands such as:

* /tpa
* /spawn
* /home
* /fly (admin)

...and more!

## API
As the development of this plugin continues, the api will build up. My current focus is to make the plugin near close to functioning before I implement API features.
